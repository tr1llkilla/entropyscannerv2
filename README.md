 Entropy Analyzer with Belnap's Logic
This project implements a C++ application designed to scan files on a Windows system, calculate their Shannon entropy, and classify their "suspiciousness" using a custom four-valued (Belnap's) logic system. Files identified as "suspicious" or "critical" based on their entropy are automatically copied to a designated quarantine/dump folder.

Features
File System Scanning: Recursively scans all files on the system drive (or a specified root).

Shannon Entropy Calculation: Computes the Shannon entropy for blocks of data within each file, providing an indicator of randomness (often associated with packed, encrypted, or compressed malicious code).

Four-Valued Logic (Belnap's Logic): Utilizes a custom FourValuedBoolean enum (True, False, Neither, Both) to represent and propagate uncertainty in analysis results.

True: Definitely suspicious/critical (high entropy).

False: Definitely benign (normal entropy).

Neither: Indeterminate/Suspicious (entropy in a grey area, requiring further analysis).

Both: Not currently used in entropy analysis, but available for representing contradictory evidence in broader logical contexts.

Logical Operators: Overloaded !, &&, and || operators for FourValuedBoolean to enable complex logical reasoning with uncertain states.

Automated File Copying: Automatically copies files classified as True (critical) or Neither (suspicious/indeterminate) by the entropy analysis to a configurable destination folder.

Console Output: Provides real-time feedback on file scanning, entropy calculation, and file copying status.
